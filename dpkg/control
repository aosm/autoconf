Description: GNU source configuration tool
 Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
 scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
 These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
 systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a
 configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
 operating system features that the package can use, in the form of m4
 macro calls.
